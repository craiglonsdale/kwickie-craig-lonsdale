Recommendation engines

First I would find some metrics about the user that describes what type of questions they frequently engage with

- Find a users most viewed VIPs
- Find the sponsors that the user has the most engagement with
- Find a users favorite questioners (could be VIP or regular user)
- Calculate an average length video that the user actively engages with (maybe a range
  either side +- 10 seconds).

For a video to be counted in these metrics it should be mostly viewed (80% or more).

Using these we can calculate the videos that fall into these different categories. Videos that fall in to more of the categories will be more highly recommended.  Additionally we might think about adding a weighting mechanic that will add different weightings to
the categories.
This will take some tweaking over time and work with users to figure out what the most important categories are to users. You could also add in a category that will show users 'viral' videos in their recommendations because you don't want to be the only one of your friends not have seen that latest hit.

In these estimates I will assume that I have prior knowledge of the database being used
and the current APIs that are implemented.

1. Generate the 4 collections - 1 day
2. Create mechanism that sorts the video into the category 'buckets' - 1 day
3. Implementing a weighting mechanism that can be tweaked by user feedback - 4h
4. Implement a mechanism to inject popular videos into the recommendation stream - 4h
